## üìù Description
* This repository represents **"Price-Prediction of Mercedes Benz"**
* With the help of this project we can meaningfully and reliably predict prices of pre-owned cars based on some relevant characteristics.

## ‚è≥ Dataset 
* Data of over 3000 pre-owned Mercedes-Benz-cars was extracted from https://www.cars.com/
* Data cleaning, organization, and feature engineering were done over the dataframe.
* Download the dataset for custom training:

## üìù Steps Involved

1. **Objective:** To build a Machine Learning model (Linear Regression) that can predict prices (label) of used cars based on various features
2. **Data Collection:** The data was scrapped from the website www.cars.com
3. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** Initially the dataset had all the data in 6 columns, the data had null values, duplicates, and noise too. After applying techniques like Data Cleaning (imputation, outlier detection, and removing duplicate records), EDA, and Feature Generation, 7 meaningful features were generated, which can be used for drawing insights through aggregations and visualization.The final dataset has the following independent features:
```bash
Name             
Mileage         
Dealer_Name      
Rating          
Review_Count      
Price           
Year    
```
4. **Data Analysis and Visualisation:** Meanwhile data analysis through groupby, pivot table, and aggregate functions was also done and the data was visualized (screenshots may be referred to).
5. **Training:** The final dataset was then split into training and testing datasets and trained through Linear Regression.
6. **Testing:** The predicted values for the label (price) were then generated. The accuracy came out to be 82%.
7. **Predicting (Applying the Model):** As a test case, predicting the price of a used car using hypothetical features seems to be quite reasonable and meaningful. The model now can be used by a user who may be a buyer/seller to predict the prices of pre-owned cars.
